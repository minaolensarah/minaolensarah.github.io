Hi :) I'm Sarah, a research assistant in the [Computational Linguistics Group](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/AK/) led by [Alexander Koller](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~koller/) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). 
I just defended my Master's Thesis supervised by Alexander Koller and [Sebastian Schuster](https://sebschu.com/) on whether LLMs can emulate Python code execution (Spoiler: They can't.) and what that tells us about LLMs learning the meaning of natural language.
