Hi :) I'm Sarah, a PhD student at the University of Vienna in [Sebastian Schuster's](https://sebschu.com/) group. Before that, I did my Bachelor's in NLP at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) and my Master's in Language Science and Technology at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). 

During my PhD, I will be looking at world models in LLMs to understand how they represent descriptions of processes or situations. Especially when state changes are involved, for example, tasks where objects are moved around or altered according to instructions, or variables in code that are updated.
